jScrollPane is a [jQuery](http://www.jquery.com/) plugin which provides you with custom scrollbars which work consistently across all modern browsers. You can easily control the appearance of the scrollbars using simple CSS and they degrade gracefully where javascript is disabled. If the mouse wheel plugin is included in the page then the scroll panes will also respond to mouse wheel events.

You can see many examples showing the use of jScrollPane on the [jScrollPane homepage](http://jscrollpane.kelvinluck.com/). If you need support it is recommended that you use either [Stack Overflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com/) (tagging your question with both "jQuery" and "jScrollPane") or the [jScrollPane google group](http://groups.google.com/group/jscrollpane/).

Since version 2 of the plugin development and issue tracking has moved to git and GitHub:
